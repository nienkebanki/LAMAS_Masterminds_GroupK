    <h2>Game rules</h2>
    <p>
    For this project, we use an adapted version of MastersMinds, based on the game as described in Verbrugge &amp; Mol (2008).
    Two players, $A$ and $B$, each choose a secret code. In our implementation, a code is a sequence of length $3$ drawn from a fixed
    set of $5$ colors (red, blue, yellow, green, pink), and repetition is not allowed.
    </p>

    <p>
    The important feature of MastersMinds is the distinction between private and public information. Each player knows their own
    secret code, but not the opponent’s. However, the outcomes of each round are publicly observed, so both players can update their
    reasoning from the same information.
    </p>

    <p>
    In each round, player $A$ makes a guess $g$ of length $3$. After a guess, the game produces feedback using two types of pins:
    black pins indicate correct color in the correct position, and white pins indicate correct color in a different position.
    The exact feedback is determined by comparing the guess with a secret code.
    </p>

    <p>
    The MastersMinds twist is that after each guess the game publicly reveals a pair of feedback results: one comparing $g$ with
    $B$’s secret code, and one comparing $g$ with $A$’s own secret code. Intuitively, this creates a strategic trade-off: the public
    outcome may help $A$ learn about $B$, while simultaneously allowing $B$ to learn something about $A$.
    </p>

    <p>
    A player wins classically by guessing the opponent’s code exactly before the opponent does. In addition, we also use an epistemic
    winning condition in our analysis: player $A$ is considered to have won once $A$ can uniquely determine $B$’s code, meaning that
    only one candidate for $B$ remains consistent with the public history.
    </p>

    <p class="muted">
    Assumptions used in our implementation: code length $3$, five available colors, no repeated colors in a code or guess, and feedback
    is always truthful and publicly visible.
