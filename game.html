    <h2>Game</h2>
    <p>
      For this research, we use a simplified and symmetric version of the Master(s)Minds game. Our variant retains the essential
      features of the original competitive setting introduced by Grachten and Druiven and analysed in
      <span class="chip">Verbrugge &amp; Mol (2008)</span>, but adapts the rules to our epistemic and information-theoretic framework.
    </p>
    <p>
      Master(s)Minds is a two-player game in which players $A$ and $B$ each secretly choose a code. In our implementation, a code is a
      sequence of length $3$ drawn from a fixed set of five colours (red, blue, yellow, green, pink), with no colour repetitions allowed.
      Thus each player has $5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 = 60$ possible secret codes. At the start of the game, each player knows their own secret
      code and considers all $60$ codes possible for the opponent.

    <h3>Feedback</h3>
    <p>
      Each round, player $A$ makes a guess $g$ of length $3$. Feedback is computed using the standard Mastermind rules:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>a black pin indicates a guessed colour in the correct position;</li>
      <li>a white pin indicates a guessed colour that appears in the secret code but in a different position.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The key Master(s)Minds twist is that the public outcome consists of a pair of feedback values:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>the feedback comparing $g$ to $B$’s secret code, and</li>
      <li>the feedback comparing $g$ to $A$’s own secret code.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      Thus the outcome simultaneously helps $A$ learn about $B$, and helps $B$ learn about $A$. Since the outcome is public, both agents
      update their epistemic model by eliminating all worlds (code-pairs) that would not have produced this exact feedback pair.
    </p>

    <h3>Game rules</h3>
    <p>We formalise the game as follows:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>At the start of the game, players $A$ and $B$ secretly select their codes independently.</li>
      <li>
        In each round, the active player (starting with $A$) chooses a legal guess $g$ of length $3$ with no repeated colours.
      </li>
      <li>
        The system computes the Mastermind feedback on $g$ against both secret codes and publicly announces the feedback pair.
      </li>
      <li>Both players perform a public-announcement update, removing all worlds inconsistent with the announced feedback.</li>
      <li>The turn then switches to the other player, who repeats the same procedure.</li>
      <li>A classical win occurs if a player explicitly guesses the opponent’s code exactly.</li>
      <li>
        An epistemic win for player $A$ occurs when $A$ knows $B$’s secret code, i.e., when the candidate set for $B$ has size $1$.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      This formulation makes the game fully symmetric and purely epistemic: players do not merely try to guess the opponent’s code, but
      must also reason about what the opponent learns about their own code after every public announcement. This interaction between
      learning and leaking lies at the heart of our strategic and information-theoretic analysis.
