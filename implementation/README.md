# Master(s)Mind(s): Epistemic & Information-Theoretic Analysis

This repository contains the implementation and experimental evaluation for a LAMAS project studying **Master(s)Mind(s)** as an epistemic game of public information exchange.

The project models Master(s)Mind(s) using **epistemic logic** and **dynamic epistemic logic (DEL)**, and evaluates player strategies using **information-theoretic measures** of learning and information leakage.  
The accompanying report provides the full formal background, logical modelling, and interpretation of the experimental results.

## Setup and Execution

All commands below assume you are working **inside the `implementation/` directory**.

---

### 1. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

**macOS / Linux**
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

**Windows (PowerShell)**
```powershell
py -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

---

### 2. Install Python Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### 3. Install `mlsolver`

This project depends on the `mlsolver` package for Kripke models and epistemic logic semantics.  
The package is included **locally** and must be installed manually.

From inside `implementation/`:

```bash
cd mlsolver
python setup.py install
cd ..
```

---

### 4. Run the Tournament

```bash
python tournament.py
```

This runs a round-robin tournament (including self-play), alternates role assignment across repetitions, and writes the results to:

```
tournament_results_selfplay.csv
```

Each row in the CSV corresponds to a single game.

---

## Strategy Pool

The tournament evaluates the following classes of strategies:

- **Guessing-focused**
- **Hiding-focused**
- **Balanced strategies** with  
  λ ∈ {0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0, 10.0}

Balanced strategies use the utility function:

```
U(g) = I_G(g) − λ · I_L(g)
```

where:
- I<sub>G</sub>(g) is the expected **information gain** about the opponent’s secret,
- I<sub>L</sub>(g) is the expected **self-information leakage** caused by the public feedback generated by guess g.

---

## Epistemic Interpretation

- The project adopts an **epistemic notion of success**, defined as knowledge-based identification of the opponent’s secret.
- There is **no procedural “first correct guess wins” rule**.
- All feedback is **public**, so belief updates are shared between players.
- As a result, **symmetric epistemic success (ties)** is expected and represents *simultaneous knowledge acquisition* rather than a draw in the classical sense.

---

## Troubleshooting

### `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'mlsolver'`

Ensure that:

- The virtual environment is activated
- Dependencies from `requirements.txt` are installed
- `python setup.py install` was executed inside the `mlsolver/` directory

Check your Python version:

```bash
python --version
```

**Python 3.10 or newer is recommended.**
