    <h2>Game rules</h2>
    <p>
      For this research, the Mastersminds game is adapted to a version that relates the purpose of the research. 
      The rules and settings are changed a bit regarding the real game invented by Druiven and Grachten and also described 
      in Verbrugge & Mol, 2008. Mastersminds is a game between two players, called $A$ and $B$, who both choose a secret code. 
      In our implementation a code is a sequence of length $3$ consisting of different colors so there is no repetition allowed. 
      Codes are chosen from a fixed set of $5$ colors: red, blue, yellow, green, pink. In each round, player $A$ makes a guess $g$ 
      of length $3$. Feedback is given using two kinds of pins: a black pin means a guessed color is in the correct position, and 
      a white pin means a guessed color occurs in the code but in a different position. The key Mastersminds twist is that after a
      guess, the game publicly reveals a feedback pair. One feedback comparing $g$ with $B$’s secret code, and one feedback comparing 
      $g$ with $A$’s own secret code. This means the public outcome helps $A$ learn about $B$, but also helps $B$ learn about $A$. A 
      player wins classically when they guess the opponent’s code exactly as first. The epistemic winning condition is that player $A$ 
      wins when $A$ knows the opponent’s code, i.e. when only one candidate for $B$ remains possible.
